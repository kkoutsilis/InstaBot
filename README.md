# InstaBot
Do you ever find yourself commenting for hours on instagram post for giveaways and losing your time?   
Well instaBot is your solution!   
InstaBot is a simple python script, using selenium that takes your instagram login credentials,  
the url of the post you want to comment,  
and the comment (most probably your frineds username :P)  
and automates the task of commenting for you!  

## Browser
This bot omnly works with Google Chrome for now (Version 87.0.4280.88)  

### Prerequisites

You need to install
* [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=JJTC&gclid=CjwKCAiAz4b_BRBbEiwA5XlVVjIcGxTS_CNWqTO8R2jV3efCX8c1tcEGSzJWjoRWjSU3clL_CFKDDxoCXNoQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) - if you don't have it
* [Chrome webDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) - check your chrome version and download the same driver version and save it at "C:\Program Files (x86)\"   
* Install [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) using the pip command of python from the command line - pip install selenium  
## Enjoy
After that run the program and you are ready to go , the bot will spam for ever (at least untill you close it) every 4 to 5 minutes so that you do not get a ban from instagram  

Feel free to fork the repo, see the code, improve the bot, try new things.  
It's far from perfect, but it's a fun project that i did to learn new stuff and there are a lot of opportunities to build upon it! ðŸ˜Š
